## About

This project contains two pages. The first is a home page where users can select a specific car and year. Afterward, they can navigate to the results page, where found car cards will be displayed. While fetching data, users will see a loader and a friendly message. In case of an error, users will see an error message and will be able to navigate back to the home page.
